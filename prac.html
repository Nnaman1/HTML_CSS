        <h1>Our Story </h1>
        <p class="lead">
            We are friends. During a virtual happy hour at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we shared our
            frustrations
            with the crisis and the impending economic recession. We were worried about how much we had lost in the
            stock market and in other investment portfolios.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Realizing the need to make some changes in our respective financial strategies, we set out on a mission to
            pull our resources together and seek out investment opportunities that we may not typically have access to,
            individually.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            So, thatâ€™s how NAIP was formed. As immigrants and minorities, we are determined to secure the future of the
            next generation by creating, growing and sustaining a platform to access private market investment
            opportunities.

        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Our funds are privately sourced and funded by our members. Our background spans more than 100 years of
            combined experience across multiple industries, sectors, disciplines including but not limited to
            medicine/care delivery, legal, corporate and business strategy, technology enablement, financial operations,
            complex program management and risk management.

        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            We are community focused but not a charity organization. We support up and coming Nigerian entrepreneurs and
            African founders in the Diaspora. We mentor, advise and guide because we understand that sometimes our
            collective experience is more valuable than our money.

        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            We are Nigerian American Investment Partners.
